### About

Dicty Tracking is a free, fast and easy-to-use standalone tool for semi-automatic tracking of migrating Dictyostelium cells from phase-contrast time-lapse image series based on MATLAB®. It requires [Fiji/ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Fiji) and the installation of [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).

The tool and it's associated files are licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE). It is provided as a .zip package containing sample image series and additional Excel workbooks for further analysis. The complete fileset is publically available on **[figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Dicty_Tracking_A_standalone_tool_for_fast_and_easy_tracking_of_migrating_Dictyostelium_cells/5024552)** and can be cited as:
