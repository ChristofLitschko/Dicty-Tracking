### About

Dicty Tracking is a MATLAB®-based standalone tool developed for semi-automatic tracking of migrating *Dictyostelium* cells from phase-contrast time-lapse image series. The tool requires [Fiji/ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Fiji) and the installation of [MATLAB Runtime](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).

#### How it works
* **Cell detection**: using the Sobel operator implemented in MATLAB®’s Image Processing Toolbox as well as subsequent
dilation and erosion steps Dicty tracking is able to efficiently detect cell bodies of migrating *Dictyostelium* cells from phase-contrast images. The adjustment of several parameters affecting accuracy of cell body detection is possible and might be necessary in some cases.
* **Quality control and cell selection**: the accuracy of cell body detection can be checked by the user in Fiji/ImageJ. Afterwards, a graphical user interface (GUI) allows the selection of cells that should be tracked by the algorithm. Usually, some cells have to be excluded from analyses due to collision, division or because they leave the field of view.
* **Cell tracking and data export**: the Dicty Tracking algorithm tracks the selected cells by connecting the centroids of a cell at each time point of the image series. Dicty Tracking generates a .tif stack with differently colored cell tracks and saves the following parameters of each tracked cell at each time point into an Excel sheet:
  * x and y position
  * distance to previous point (D2pP, step size)
  * overall track length (Len)
  * direct distance to the starting point (distance to start, D2S)
  * instantaneous velocity (v)
  * instantaneous angle (angle between the displacement vector and the x-axis)
  * turning angle (difference of subsequent instantaneous angles)
  * the cosine of the turning angle.
* **Further analyses**: Dicty Tracking comes with additional VBA-based Excel workbooks allowing the calculation of
  * mean speed
  * directionality ratio
  * mean squared displacement (MSD).

A more detailed description of *Dictyostelium* cell tracking and subsequent migration analyses with Dicty Tracking is offered in the [user guide](https://github.com/ChristofLitschko/Dicty-Tracking/blob/master/Dicty-Tracking-User-Guide.pdf).
